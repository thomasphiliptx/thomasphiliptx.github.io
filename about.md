Hi, Iâ€™m Jenn! ðŸ‘‹  
Iâ€™m a senior neuroscience major at the University of Texas, passionate about brain science, problem-solving, and bridging medicine with business.  

Currently, Iâ€™m preparing to move to New York City to start my career in life sciences consulting.  
In my free time, I love Jeep adventures, Star Wars, and exploring new cities.
